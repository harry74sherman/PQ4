"galadriel","it began with the forging of the great rings."
"galadriel","three were given to the elves, immortal, wisest...fairest of all beings."
"galadriel","seven to the dwarf lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls."
"galadriel","and nine...nine rings were gifted to the race of men who, above all else, desire power."
"galadriel","for within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race."
"galadriel","but they were all of them deceived."
"galadriel","...for another ring was made."
"galadriel","in the land of mordor, in the fires of mount doom, the dark lord sauron forged in secret a master ring to control all others."
"galadriel","...and into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life."
"galadriel","one ring to rule them all..."
"galadriel","one by one the free lands of middle earth fell to the power of the ring."
"galadriel","but there were some...who resisted."
"bilbo","what's this?"

"bilbo","welcome, welcome!!"
"bilbo","i was expecting you some time last week."
"bilbo","not that it matters, you come and go as you please, always have done, always will."
"bilbo","you've caught me a bit unprepared, i'm afraid...we've only got cold chicken, bit of pickle, some cheese here...ooh, no, that might be a little risky..."
"bilbo","er, we've got raspberry jam and apple tart...got some custard somewhere."
"bilbo","not much for afters, I'm afraid."
"bilbo","oh no...we're alright...I've just found some sponge cake."
"bilbo","nice little snack."
"bilbo","hope it's enough."
